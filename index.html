    <h3><u>About me</u></h3>
    <p>My name is Dalton Wettlaufer and I'm making this site to act as a hub to showcase any future projects I work on.
      I'm hoping to keep on this track and learn some web development skills that I may use to make fat stacks. Or
      skinny stacks.
      Honestly, I'd take any size of stacks to keep my refrigerator running.

      I spend most of my time like a lot of people do; Running on my corporate rat race wheel of existential dread.
      In my off time I try to have as much fun as possible. Spending time with friends, watching anime and movies, and
      playings TTRPGS! Mostly D&D 5e and Stars Without Number, but if anyone has an open slot I'd play any kind of TTRPG
      to be honest.

      I have also played video games pretty much my entire life. I play pretty much every genre (except for sports
      games. Absolutely zero shade thrown if that's your shtick, It's just not mine >_>). However as of writing this, I
      have been obsessed with roguelike games for a while now.<br>
      My current game addict scratch is Slay the Spire, a deckbuilding roguelike where you travel up a randomly
      generated tower fighting monsters and bosses with a deck of skills and attacks you pick up along the way. Below
      I'll make a table of my current top roguelike games and if you have any suggestions, get in touch!
